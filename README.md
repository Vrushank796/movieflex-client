# MovieFlex - Moving Booking Web Application

• Developed a movie booking website using ReactJS, typescript for frontend, ExpressJS for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
• Also used the nodemailer library for the email functionality. Used the TMDB movie dataset to create API endpoints. 
• Users can search for movies and view the movie details along with the recommended movies. 
• On successful login, users can book movie tickets by selecting theatre, show date, show time, and seats. 
• Users can review the theatre and movie show info on the checkout page and add the dummy payment info to finally book the movie tickets. 
• A user would get the movie ticket details in their mail. 
• On my orders page, user can check their booked tickets. Using the admin panel, the admin can handle the database for creating and modifying the movie, and user details, and view the ticket details.
